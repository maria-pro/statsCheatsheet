Linear regression:

## standard error 
"typical" distance between the estimated and the "true" coefficient.

** standard deviaion of the sampling distribution of the estimate of the coefficient (e.g. standard error of variable X)

** an estimate of the variance of the strength of the effect, 
= the strength of the relationship between each causal variable and the predicted variable. 

**High standard errors**: you can't estimate the coefficient precisely, the 'true' coefficient is very far away from  the estimated value 

## t-statistic

* the coefficient divided by its standard error
* a measure of the precision with which the regression coefficient is measured.
* an estimate of how extreme the value you see is, relative to the standard error 

## p-value 

*an estimate of the probability of seeing a t-value as extreme, or more extreme the one you got

## null hypothesis 

* is usually "no effect", unless something else is specified

* if the p-value is very low, then there is a higher probability that you're seeing data that is counter-indicative of zero effect. In other situations, you can get a p-value based on other statistics and variables.
